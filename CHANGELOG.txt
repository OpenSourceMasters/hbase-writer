HBase-Writer Change Log

Current /trunk - Compatible with hadoop-2.4.0, hbase-0.98.7-hadoop2 & heritrix-3.2.0

Release 0.98.7 - 23.11.2014
	1. Added wrapper method so all data added to the put object gets serialized if a 
		serializer is specified in the configurable parameters. Also ensuring both request 
		and response streams are closed at the end of the write to the table. Both have 
		the potential to be open if the custom method is used and streams are not closed, 
		now this shouldn't be a problem.
	2. Added bug fix to shouldProcess() method. If a record got an IOException, it was 
		logging the record as an error but still trying to process the record. Now it returns 
		false and the record wont be processed. Also updated comments.
	3. Logging heritrix annotations if any are encountered during the crawl.  For example if a fetched url has
		data larger than the max size limit, no data will be written but an annotation "c:an" => "size" will get written 
		now instead.
	4. Shortened the default table column names to be more reasonable. Added a configurable delimiter 
		when annotations are present.
	5. Bug fixes, checking for null and allowing setter for column name variables.  Moving properties to top 
		of pom.xml file.  Updating maven plugin versions to their latest versions.  Added support to use latest 
		version of hadoop and hbase and heritrix dependencies. Now including a list of dependencies 
		to make it easier to update hbase-writer dependencies inside of heritrix/lib

Release 0.94.0 - 1.9.2013
	1. Upgraded to latest release version of HBase and all dependencies.
	2. Fixed exception handling bug in makeWriter() method.  Now exceptions are being properly logged.
	3. Updated README docs to include the new dependencies that need to be copied over to ${HERITRIX_HOME}/lib

Release 0.90.4 - 23.1.2012
	1. Added support to change max file size.
	2. Major bug fix submitted by Greg Lu, all the usages of the connection pooling functionality built into Heritrix were not being used
		and instead HBase-writer was creating a new HTable objects indirectly for every page being saved.  This has been fixed.
		Even worse, the connections weren't being cleaned up properly and would stick around until the process was shut down.    
		The connections are now being closed.  Thanks again to Greg Lu for the work done to fix this problem.

	3. Moved all configuration options to HBaseParameters class and cleaned up naming.

  3rd Release - Compatible with hadoop-0.18.2, hbase-0.18.1 & heritrix 2.0.1
  ISSUE-6 - Adding maximum content size support.  If content items collected by heritrix exceed the hard-coded limit of 20MB, 
  then the writer will ignore fetching this item.  This is to prevent HBase from hanging on large record writes.  
  (Patch submitted by Andrew Purtell via Ryan Smith)

  ISSUE-5 - If HBase throws an exception, the Hbase-Writer is not added back to the writer pool.  
  (Patch submitted by Andrew Purtell via Ryan Smith)
