This is a processor for heritrix that writes fetched pages to hbase.

= Introduction =

The layout of this contribution is modeled after Doug Judds
heritrix-hadoop-dfs-processor available off the heritrix home page.

This software is licensed under the LGPL.  See accompanying LICENSE.txt document.

The heritrix-hadoop-dfs-writer-processor is an extension to the Heritrix open
source crawler written by the Internet Archive (http://crawler.archive.org/)
that enables it to store crawled content directly into HDFS, the Hadoop
Distributed FileSystem (http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/).  Hadoop implements
the Map/Reduce distributed computation framework on top of HDFS.  
heritrix-hadoop-dfs-writer-processor writes crawled content into SequenceFile
format which is directly supported by the Map/Reduce framework and has support
for compression.  This facilitates running high-speed, distributed computations
over content crawled with Heritrix.

The current version of heritrix-hadoop-dfs-writer-processor assumes version
2.0.x of Heritrix and version 0.18.x of Hadoop.  Newer versions of Hadoop
and Heritrix may continue to work with this connector as long as the pertinent
APIs have not changed.  Just replace the jar files with the newer versions.


= SETUP =
 *. Start an instance of hbase.
 *. Install heritrix-2.0.x
 *. Copy the following jar files into the ${HERITRIX_HOME}/lib directory:

  hbase-writer-x.x.x.jar

  hbase-x.x.x.jar

  hadoop-x.x.x-core.jar

  log4j-x.x.x.jar

 *. Start Heritrix


= CONFIGURING HERITRIX =

On the "Settings for sheet 'global'":

 * Click on a 'details' link and add new processor com.powerset.heritrix.writer.HBaseWriterProcessor.
 * Return to the global sheet and set this as your writer (the page will not draw completely if did not type in the name of the processor properly -- see heritrix_out.log for errors).
 * Set at least the master and table configuration for HBaseWriterProcessor.

master
  The host and port of the hbase master server.

table
  Which table to crawl into.

= COMPILING THE SOURCE =
The source is built using Maven2.
  mvn clean compile

= BUILDING THE JAR =
  mvn clean package

The hbase-writer-x.x.x.jar should be in the target/ directory.  

= OBTAINING THE DEPENDENCY JARS =
You can get the hadoop (http://hadoop.apache.org/core/), hbase (http://hbase.org/) and log4j jars from downloading the releases from these 2 sites.
You can also get the hadoop, hbase and log4j dependency jars from your ${HOME}/.m2/repository/ directory after you have built the project using maven.
For example:
  cp ${HOME}/.m2/repository/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/0.18.1/hbase-0.18.1.jar ${HERITRIX_HOME}/lib/

  cp ${HOME}/.m2/repository/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-core/0.18.1/hadoop-core-0.18.1.jar ${HERITRIX_HOME}/lib/ 

  cp ${HOME}/.m2/repository/log4j/log4j/1.2.14/log4j-1.2.14.jar ${HERITRIX_HOME}/lib/

You can also get them by visiting the hbase-writer archive repository:
http://repo1.opensourcemasters.org:8081/nexus/

  
= UPGRADING TO NEW HADOOP/HBASE/HERITRIX VERSIONS =
The hbase-writer project will be keeping up to date with the latest hadoop, hbase and heritrix versions, but if you would like to compile and build hbase-writer against different versions, you are able to do so with maven2 without changing any versioned files.

To build hbase-writer with new versions of hadoop, hbase or heritrix (or any of the dependencies), use a ${HOME}/.m2/settings.xml file.

A sample settings.xml file:
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <settings>
  <profiles>
	<profile>
	  <id>myBuild</id>
	  <properties>
            <heritrix.version>2.0.2</heritrix.version>
            <hbase.version>0.18.1</hbase.version>
            <hadoop.version>0.18.1</hadoop.version>
	  </properties>
	</profile>
  </profiles>
 </settings> 
  
Place this file in your ${HOME}/.m2/ directory and run the maven build command:
 mvn clean package -PmyBuild 
 
By typing the command:
 mvn help:effective-pom -PmyBuild

you will get the resolved pom.xml dumped to stdout.  Here you can verify that
you are overriding the properties correctly.

= BUILDING THE SITE REPORT =

  mvn clean site
