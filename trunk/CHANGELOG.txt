HBase-Writer Change Log

Current /trunk - Compatible with hadoop-core-0.20.205.0, hbase-0.90.3 & heritrix 3.1.0

Release 0.90.4 - 23.1.2012
	1. Added support to change max file size.
	2. Major bug fix submitted by Greg Lu, all the usages of the connection pooling functionality built into Heritrix were not being used
		and instead HBase-writer was creating a new HTable objects indirectly for every page being saved.  This has been fixed.
		Even worse, the connections weren't being cleaned up properly and would stick around until the process was shut down.    
		The connections are now being closed.  Thanks again to Greg Lu for the work done to fix this problem.

  ISSUE-6 - Adding maximum content size support.  If content items collected by heritrix exceed the hard-coded limit of 20MB, 
  then the writer will ignore fetching this item.  This is to prevent HBase from hanging on large record writes.  
  (Patch submitted by Andrew Purtell via Ryan Smith)

  ISSUE-5 - If HBase throws an exception, the Hbase-Writer is not added back to the writer pool.
