  3rd Release - Compatible with hadoop-0.18.2, hbase-0.18.1 & heritrix 2.0.1
  ISSUE-6 - Adding maximum content size support.  If content items collected by heritrix exceed the hard-coded limit of 20MB, 
  then the writer will ignore fetching this item.  This is to prevent HBase from hanging on large record writes.

  ISSUE-5 - If HBase throws an exception, the Hbase-Writer is not added back to the writer pool.
